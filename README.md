### Match Making (Ticket Based Posting a Challenge/Match)
1. A player will deposit a small fee (Approx. Rs. 10. This will be refunded if they can't match on their specified time) to create a Match Making Ticket and publish it to public.
2. If Someone accepts the ticket and they will confirm by depositing the the same fee. Now the match making ticket has been resolved and a new upcoming match will be added to both players. Now no refund is possible. 
3. They can now have a chat and further discuss from the chat feature.
4. The will commence on the time specified.
5. We'll incentivize all the players who contributes on updating the commentary and score by providing exp points. Which can be later used as a currency in the futsal house ecosystem.
